				<div class="content__item-text">
					<p>When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted with a young American couple
						who had among their belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven—attractive but not
						practicably companionable with me, because he knew no English. He had played from his birth with
						the little Kanakas on his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and would learn
						no other. The family removed to America a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway
						the boy began to lose his Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he hadn’t a word
						of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed from his tongue and from his comprehension.
						Nine years later, when he was twenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New
						York, and the mother told me about an adventure which her son had been having. By trade he was
						now a professional diver. A passenger boat had been caught in a storm on the lake, and had gone
						down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the young diver descended, with his armor
						on, and entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of the companionway, with
						his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water. Presently something touched him on the
						shoulder, and he turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and seemingly
						inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with fright.</p>
					<p>His entry had disturbed the water, and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him
						and wagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance. His senses
						forsook him, and in that condition he was drawn to the surface. He was put to bed at home, and
						was soon very ill. During some days he had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a
						time; and while they lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and Kanaka only. He was
						still very ill, and he talked to me in that tongue; but I did not understand it, of course. The
						doctor-books tell us that cases like this are not uncommon. Then the doctors ought to study the
						cases and find out how to multiply them. Many languages and things get mislaid in a person’s
						head, and stay mislaid for lack of this remedy.</p>
					<p>Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were sent ashore; but nobody could go
						ashore and return. There were people on shore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we
						could not receive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term in Sydney. They could have
						escaped the day before, by ship to San Francisco; but the bars had been put up, now, and they
						might have to wait weeks before any ship could venture to give them a passage any whither. And
						there were hardships for others. An elderly lady and her son, recreation-seekers from
						Massachusetts, had wandered westward, further and further from home, always intending to take
						the return track, but always concluding to go still a little further; and now here they were at
						anchor before Honolulu positively their last westward-bound indulgence—they had made up their
						minds to that—but where is the use in making up your mind in this world? It is usually a waste
						of time to do it. These two would have to stay with us as far as Australia. Then they could go
						on around the world, or go back the way they had come; the distance and the accommodations and
						outlay of time would be just the same, whichever of the two routes they might elect to take.
						Think of it: a projected excursion of five hundred miles gradually enlarged, without any
						elaborate degree of intention, to a possible twenty-four thousand. However, they were used to
						extensions by this time, and did not mind this new one much.</p>
